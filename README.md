# Golang Basic Demos

This repository contains multiple basic Golang example programs suitable for beginners to learn and practice. Each example covers different aspects of Golang, from a simple "Hello World" to concurrent programming and web servers. Through these examples, you can gradually master the core concepts and syntax of Golang.

## Example Descriptions

### Hello World
The most basic introductory program, outputting "Hello, World!".

### FizzBuzz
A classic programming exercise, printing numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz"; for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

### Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game where the program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. The user inputs guesses, and the program hints whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

### Fibonacci Sequence
Generates the first N terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

### Concurrent Calculation
Uses Goroutines and Channels for concurrent calculation, such as summing numbers from 1 to 100.

### Web Server
Creates a simple HTTP server that returns "Hello, World!".

### JSON Handling
Reads JSON data and parses it into a struct.

### File I/O
Reads the content of a file and writes it to another file.
